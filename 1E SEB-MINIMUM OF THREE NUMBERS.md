# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Find the largest among three Integer Numbers

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the largest among three integer numbers.
## ALGORITHM  
Start the program.

Read three integer numbers from the user.

Use conditional statements to compare the numbers:

If a > b and a > c, then a is the largest.

Else if b > a and b > c, then b is the largest.

Else, c is the largest.

Display the largest number.

End the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
max=max(a,b,c)
print("The largest of the three a= {} b= {} c= {} is {}".format(a,b,c,max))

```
