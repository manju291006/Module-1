## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Find the maximum of two float numbers using conditional expression 

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the maximum of two float numbers using a conditional expression.
## ALGORITHM  
Start the program.

Read two float numbers from the user.

Use the conditional expression (ternary operator) to find the maximum:

Display the maximum number.

End the program.

## PROGRAM
```
a=float(input())
b=float(input())
max=max(a,b)
print("The maximum of {} and {} is {}".format(a,b,max))

```
