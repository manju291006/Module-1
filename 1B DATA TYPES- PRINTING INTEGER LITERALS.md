# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Print the type of the variable

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the type of a variable.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Start the program.

2. Declare and initialize variables of different data types.

3. Use the type() function to find the type of each variable.

4. Print the variable value along with its data type.

5.End the program.

## PROGRAM

```
a=bool(input())
print(type(a))

```
