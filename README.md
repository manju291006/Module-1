# Experiment No: 1a Python Basics- get and print any vowels using character literal
## AIM  
To write a C program that reads a character from the user and prints whether it is a vowel or not using character literals.

## ALGORITHM  
Step 1: Start the program.

Step 2: Declare a variable ch of type char to store the character.

Step 3: Read a character from the user using scanf().

Step 4: Check whether the character is a vowel or not by comparing it with character literals:

Step 5:If the character matches any of the above, print "It is a vowel".
Otherwise, print "It is not a vowel".

Step 6: Stop the program.

## PROGRAM
```
b=[]
for a in ['A','O']:
    a=input()
    print(a)

```
