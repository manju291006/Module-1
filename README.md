# Experiment No: 1a Python Basics- get and print any vowels using character literal
## AIM  
To write a C program that reads a character from the user and prints whether it is a vowel or not using character literals.

## ALGORITHM  
Step 1: Start the program.

Step 2: Declare a variable ch of type char to store the character.

Step 3: Read a character from the user using scanf().

Step 4: Check whether the character is a vowel or not by comparing it with character literals:

Step 5:If the character matches any of the above, print "It is a vowel".
Otherwise, print "It is not a vowel".

Step 6: Stop the program.

## PROGRAM
```
b=[]
for a in ['A','O']:
    a=input()
    print(a)

```

# Experiment No: 1b DATATYPES- Read one string and integer and print the values.
## AIM  
To write a Python program to read one string and one integer from the user and display the values.

## ALGORITHM  
Start the program.

Input a string value from the user.

Input an integer value from the user.

Display the string and integer values.

Stop the program.
## PROGRAM
```
a=int (input())
b=input()
print(a,b)

```
## OUTPUT
<img width="718" height="225" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d5be38b-2231-402b-b61f-90fe68dc8681" />

# Experiment No: 1c VARIABLES & EXPRESSIONS OPERATOR - convert temperature from degree Celsius to Fahrenheit
## AIM  
To write a Python program to convert temperature from degree Celsius to Fahrenheit.
## ALGORITHM  
Start the program.

Read the temperature in degree Celsius from the user.

Process the temperature to convert it into Fahrenheit.

Display the temperature in Fahrenheit.

Stop the program.
## PROGRAM
```
a=float(input())
f = (a * 1.8) + 32
print("Celsius = {:.2f}".format(a))
print("Fahrenheit = {:.2f}".format(f))

```
## OUTPUT
<img width="611" height="296" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc5d9f73-8f06-43c4-8318-065a691ffe50" />


## RESULT
thus the program was executed successfully 








# Experiment No: 1d CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS - check whether the grade is A grade using simple if statement
## AIM  
To write a Python program to check whether the given grade is "A" using a simple if statement.
## ALGORITHM  
Start the program.

Read the grade from the user.

Check if the grade is equal to "A" using a simple if statement.

Display the result based on the condition.

Stop the program.

Step 6: Stop the program.

## PROGRAM
```
a=input()
if a.upper()=='A':
    print("Yes,The grade is 'A'")
else:
    print(" ")

```
## OUTPUT
<img width="593" height="209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f07ccdc-560b-43f4-b0a5-d14e03b37c0e" />


## RESULT
Thus the program was successfully executed and verified.







# Experiment No: 1e SEB- find the largest among three Integer Numbers 
## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the largest among three integer numbers.

## ALGORITHM  
Start the program.

Read three integer numbers from the user.

Compare the numbers using conditional statements to find the largest.

Display the largest number.

Stop the program.
## PROGRAM
```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
max=max(a,b,c)
print("The largest of the three a= {} b= {} c= {} is {}".format(a,b,c,max))



```
## OUTPUT
<img width="758" height="285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/033c9407-cdec-4cab-8a39-c572b8af8cdc" />



## RESULT
Thus the program was successfully executed and verified.
